                <section>
                    I am a growth-driven and team-oriented technology enthusiast with a focus on CyberSecurity
                    and Network Engineering. I  bring an academic background in programming and electronics to
                    my work, as well as an engineer's mindset! I take a holistic systems approach to all that I
                    do, delivering secure and effective solutions. I enjoy technology both as a profession, and
                    also as a hobby, maintaining an elaborate home-lab and GitHub portfolio. Technology is always
                    changing, and I am always learning (check my LinkedIn for proof)!
